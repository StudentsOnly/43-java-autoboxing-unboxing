### Exercise: Autoboxing and Unboxing

#### Objective:

- Practice autoboxing and unboxing in Java by creating a program that performs integer operations using primitives and wrapper classes.

#### Instructions:

- Create a class called IntegerOperations to perform integer operations using both primitive and wrapper classes.
- In IntegerOperations, perform the following operations:
    - Add two integers using Integer wrapper class (autoboxing).
    - Subtract two integers using Integer wrapper class (unboxing).
    - Multiply two integers using Integer wrapper class (autoboxing).
    - Divide two integers using Integer wrapper class (unboxing).
-	Display the results of each operation.
